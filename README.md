# servletJspWebDevelopment
**1**.Contains example of dynamic web project using maven,java 8,apache tomcat 9.<br/>
**2**.Servlet is added to return dynamic html.<br/>
**3**.As a good practice return redirect url from post method.<br/>
by this way after receiving response user cannot resbmit the form by refreshing browser refresh button.<br/>
**4**. __Cookie__ are created by server if in request it did not receive any from client request and after that it is exchanged b/w server-client in each request. in thi way user can be identified.<br/>
Cookie can store text data only. and mostly browser allows max 4kb size for cookie.it is stored in client harddisk.the server uses Set-Cookie HTTP-header in the response to set a cookie<br/>
